# Load-Balancer-Simulation
This project is a Python-based simulation of a cloud server load balancer that dynamically assigns and liberates servers to handle user requests. The load balancer ensures that CPU usage remains consistent across all active servers according to a target percentage set by the user. When server utilization drops below a threshold, the load balancer frees up resources by releasing servers.
